## Migration Notes

### LangChain 0.1.0 → 0.2.5

The major version upgrade of LangChain may require code changes:

1. **Import Changes:**
   - Some imports may have moved between packages
   - Check the [LangChain migration guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/migration)

2. **API Changes:**
   - `LLMChain` usage patterns may have changed
   - Some retriever interfaces might be updated

3. **Testing Required:**
   - Run all tests after upgrade
   - Pay special attention to RAG chain functionality
   - Test HyDE retriever functionality

### Code Compatibility Checks

Before deploying the updated dependencies:

1. **Run all unit tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

2. **Run integration tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -m integration
   ```

3. **Test critical functionality:**
   - RAG chain query processing
   - Vector store operations
   - Prometheus metrics integration
   - API endpoints

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Regular Security Scans

- **Automated scans:** GitHub Actions runs security scans on every push and weekly
- **Manual scans:** Run `pip-audit` locally before commits
- **Dependabot:** Automatically creates PRs for dependency updates

### 2. Dependency Management

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review security advisories regularly
- Test thoroughly after updates
- Use exact version pinning for production

### 3. Security Workflow

1. **Weekly automated scans** via GitHub Actions
2. **Automatic issue creation** when vulnerabilities are found
3. **PR comments** with security scan results
4. **Artifact uploads** of security reports

### 4. Local Security Testing

Run security scans locally:

```bash
# Install security tools
pip install pip-audit safety

# Run pip-audit
pip-audit --desc

# Run safety check
safety check

# Generate detailed reports
pip-audit --format json --output pip-audit-report.json
safety check --json --output safety-report.json
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

1. **GitHub Security Alerts:** Enable in repository settings
2. **Dependabot Alerts:** Automatically enabled with dependabot.yml
3. **Weekly Security Scans:** Via GitHub Actions
4. **Issue Creation:** Automatic when vulnerabilities are found

## Response Process

When vulnerabilities are detected:

1. **Assess Impact:** Review the vulnerability details and affected components
2. **Update Dependencies:** Update to recommended versions in requirements.txt
3. **Test Thoroughly:** Run all tests and verify functionality
4. **Deploy Carefully:** Use staged rollout if possible
5. **Monitor:** Watch for any issues after deployment
